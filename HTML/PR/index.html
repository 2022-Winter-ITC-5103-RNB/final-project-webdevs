                        submitting a self-assessed profile.  Once your profile has been completed and your CRS has been calculated
                        , you will be placed into a pool of candidates ranked by their CRS score.  Each profile in the pool is scored
                        using a Comprehensive Ranking System.  The best scoring profiles are issued Invitations to Apply (ITAs) via
                        regular Express Entry draws, usually every two weeks.  Only a limited number of candidates with the highest
                        CRS points in the pool are issued ITAS.

                        in English or French. Candidates who receive an ITA must submit a full application within 90-days.
