                            <p> Many newcomers planning to arrive in Canada during fall or winter tend to go shopping
                                for winter wear in their home countries. While it’s advisable to purchase some
                                essentials to get through the initial days, you will find
                                more variety and have access to clothing and accessories that are specifically built to
                                withstand Canadian weather if you buy your winter gear in Canada.
                            </p>

                            <p> This is especially true if you’re moving from temperate or tropical countries.
                            </p>


                            <p>Every popular retailer and brand in Canada has sales at the beginning and conclusion of
                                the seasons. Black Friday weekend in November and Canadian Thanksgiving weekend in
                                October are also popular periods to discover amazing
                                deals. </p>

                        <p>A bunting or snowsuit is a terrific way to keep your baby warm and protected from the
                            elements. Most snowsuits have hoods and feature form-fitting legs and arms. Buntings are
                            more like small sleeping bags, with a seam between the
                            legs to help with stroller snap-ins.
                        </p>

                        <p>You can use a baby carrier to keep your baby close to your body and avoid wrapping them in a
                            snowsuit. Using jacket extenders, a baby carrier is inserted between your own jackets.</p>

                        <p>If you plan to take your baby out frequently throughout the winter, a fuzzy seat liner for
                            the stroller or a stroller muff that provides extra bottom warmth may be worthwhile
                            investments. When shopping for a stroller, seek for
                            one with larger wheels for better all-terrain performance, as well as specially designed
                            coverings to keep your kid safe from rain, snow, and wind.</p>
