                        <img id="img_customer_service" src="/assets/STUDENTLIFE/customer_service.png" alt="customer_service">

                        <p>Customer se rvice positions have risen to the top of the list as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020 and early 2021, support lines received record calls from customers cancelling plans and asking refunds, or simply seeking
                            answers to a company's COVID process. Customer support representatives are still in great demand, despite the fact that some of the confusion has subsided. Many businesses have closed or decreased their physical locations,
                            or simply switched to entirely virtual operations. Furthermore, many call centre jobs are remote, allowing you to work from anywhere.</p>

                        <p>Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador are among the most in-demand regions.

                        <p>Freelancers come in a variety of shapes and sizes. A freelancer can work as a writer, a web designer, a graphic designer, and so on. You can work as a freelancer in almost any field. We'll concentrate on freelance writing for the
                            sake of time (and space).</p>


                        <p> This is an excellent alternative for you if you enjoy writing or editing. You have complete control over not just what you write about, but also where and when you write, whether at home or abroad. If you have free time in between
                            school assignments, why not put your skills to work while getting paid? If you want to work as a writer, this is a terrific method to obtain experience and improve your résumé. If you’re looking to get started, try <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">UpWork</a>,

                        <p>Working in a coffee shop is a dream come true for many youngsters! The atmosphere is pleasant, and who can say no to caffeine? Due to their flexible schedules, coffee businesses love to hire students. Despite the fact that this
                            is one of the lower-paying jobs on the list, it does come with perks. Students enjoy remarkable advantages if they choose to work at a company like Starbucks, which may make working there worthwhile.</p>

                        <p class="subheading">4. Uber driver</p>
                        <img src="/assets/STUDENTLIFE/Uber_Driver.webp" alt="Uber_Driver">

                        <p>In Canada, being an Uber driver has become a popular part-time profession for international students. A student must be at least 21 years old, have a car, and a smartphone in order to operate as an Uber driver. Early mornings,
                            nights, and weekends are the most profitable times to work. How much you earn is determined by how often you drive. Pay ranges from $14.00 to $25.58 per hour.</p>

                        <p class="subheading">5. Tutor</p>
                        <img src="/assets/STUDENTLIFE/Tutor.jpg" alt="Tutor">

                        <p> What exactly is a tutor? Whatever it is that you are good at! Maybe you excelled in math, science, or any other topic in school. In your leisure time, you may put those skills to use by working part-time with elementary or high
                            school students. You can charge whatever you like (more or less), but the average Canadian tutor earns around $16 per hour. Granted, you'll have to be creative in your search for pupils, but the strength of social media these
                            days puts the odds in your favor.</p>

                        <p class="subheading">6. Warehouse Worker</p>
                        <img src="/assets/STUDENTLIFE/Warehouse_Job.webp" alt="Warehouse_Worker">

                        <p>In Canada, how much does a warehouse worker earn? In Canada, the average warehouse worker earns $31,200 per year, or $16 per hour. Starting salaries for entry-level employment start at $27,906, with most experienced workers earning
