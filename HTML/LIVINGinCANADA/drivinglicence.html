            <h1> Get a G driver’s license: new drivers </h1><br>
            <img class="licence" src="/assets/LIVINGinCANADA/licence.jpg" alt="LICENCE">
                <p>If you are at least 16 years old, you can apply for driver’s licence in Ontario. As a new driver, you will need to practice driving and gain experience over time. For most people, the two-step process takes about 20 months to finish. Here’s how you get a driver’s licence.</p>
                <p>The Ontario driver’s licence is a blue, plastic card that displays your name, address, date of birth, photo and signature. The licence has an expiry date. You have to renew it before it expires.</p>
            <h2>Driving in Ontario</h2>
                <p>To drive on Ontario roads, you need to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Carry a valid driver’s licence, at all times</li>
                    <li> Have a valid owner’s permit, licence plate and insurance</li>
                    <li> Obey traffic laws and drive safely</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Licence types</h2>
            <img class="type" src="/assets/LIVINGinCANADA/licence-types-canada.png" alt="type"></img>
                <p>Ontario has 15 types of licences. Each licence certifies you to drive a specific type of vehicle. To drive a car, van or small truck, you will need a G class licence.</p>

            <p>All licences come with certain conditions. See Ontario’s full list of licences.</p>

            <h2>Apply for a driver’s licence</h2>
            <p>To apply for a driver’s licence in Ontario, you need to:</p>

                    <li>Pass a knowledge test about the rules of the road and traffic signs</li>

                </ol>
            <p>Once you pass these tests, you get a G1 licence. You are considered a beginner driver and need to practice driving and gain experience over time.</p>

             <h1> Learning to drive: graduated licensing</h1>
                <p> Once you pass your eye and knowledge tests, you get a G1 licence. Before you can get a full G licence, you have to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Finish two learning levels: G1 and G2</li>
                    <li>Pass two road tests</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This process is called “graduated licensing.” It is designed to give new drivers time to practice and gain driving experience over time.</p>

                <p>You have up to five years to finish the whole process. After five years, if you do not get your full G licence, you will need to start over.</p>

                <h2>G1 licence</h2>
                <p>By law, when you have a G1 licence, you must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintain a zero blood alcohol level (no alcohol in your blood)</li>
                    <li>Make sure every passenger with you wears a properly working seatbelt</li>
                    <li>Not drive between midnight and 5 a.m.</li>
                    <li>Not drive on 400-series highways or high-speed expressways (e.g., 401, Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW), Gardiner Expressway)</li>
                    <li>Drive with a fully licensed driver who has:</li>
                    <ul>
                       <li> At least four years of driving experience</li>
                       <li> A blood alcohol level of less than .05 (if this person is 21 and under, their blood alcohol level should be zero)</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>The driver accompanying you must be the only other person in the front seat. If you are driving with a driver instructor certified in Ontario, you can drive on any road.</p>

               <p> In most cases, you practice with your G1 licence for 12 months.</p>

                <h2>G2 road test (G1 exit test)</h2>
                <p>This is the first of two tests you need to take as a new driver.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can take your first road test after 12 months with a G1 licence</li>
                    <li>This exam tests basic driving skills such as:</li>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Turning left and right</li>
                    <li>Stopping</li>
                    <li>Parallel parking</li>
                    <li>One-way streets</li>
                    <li>Lane changes</li>
                    <li>3-point turns</li>
                    <li>Driving in residential neighbourhoods</li>
                    <li>Traffic lights, stop and yield signs</li>
                 </ul>
                   <li> once you pass, you get your G2 licence</li>
                </ul>
                    If you finish an government-approved driver education course, you can take your first road test after just eight months.
