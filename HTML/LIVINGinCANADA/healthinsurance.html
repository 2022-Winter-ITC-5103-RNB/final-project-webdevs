                    <h2 class="subheading"> OHIP ALTERNATIVE INSURANCE (Health coverage in Canada)</h2>
                        <p>This summary contains details for the International Students.  It is not a contract of insurance. The terms and conditions of the Group Policy will depend on health insurance providers’ policies.  The International Student plan provides coverage for medically necessary hospital and medical services for you, and your eligible dependents. Reimbursement of benefits will be made only upon the submission of verification from the hospital, attending physician, or surgeon that the services claimed were rendered. Certain Maximums and restrictions may apply.</p>
                        <p>Health care insurance is mandatory for all international students. For all full-time, fee-paying, international students, the cost of this basic health care insurance is included within the tuition fees.</p>  
                    
                    <h2 class="subheading">COVERAGE UPON ARRIVAL</h2>

                    <h3>Travel Insurance</h3>
                        <p>Any insurance provided by your college will effective only from the first day of classes, not from your date of arrival in Canada. Therefore, if you arrive before the start of classes, it is strongly recommended that you purchase travel insurance, including health care insurance, to cover yourself until the first official day of classes.</p>
                        
                    <h2 class="subheading">COVERAGE WHILE YOU ARE IN COLLEGE </h2>
                    
                    <h3>Full-Time Students</h3>
                        <p>Full-time paid international students are covered under the college health insurance plan from the first day of classes. The insurance fee is pro-rated based on the semester you begin your studies, i.e., September, January, or May. The health care insurance is a basic package that is subject to change on an annual basis. It is important to emphasize that not all health conditions are covered.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Please note:</h4> 
                        <p>Returning students who opt to take the semester off (next term) will not be covered until the semester they return to school.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Part-Time Students</h3>  
                        <p>International students who drop to part-time study status will be charged health insurance.</p>
                        <p>This will be reflected on the college account. As a part-time student, you are no longer eligible for the health benefits offered through the provider’s website health insurance program, i.e., drugs, dental, and other extended health benefits.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Review Your Coverage</h3>
                            <p>International students are strongly urged to review their coverage information and purchase additional insurance coverage as appropriate. If you have any questions, please contact an International Student Advisor (ISA) in the International Office.</p>
                            <p>This health insurance coverage is for international students only. It does not include spouses or children. If you have a spouse and/or dependents, you may wish to pay a supplemental fee and purchase insurance. Arrangements for adding family members are made directly with the health insurance provider. The option to add family members will not be available until the start of the semester.</p>
                            <h2 class="subheading">What is Not Fully Covered by the Ontario Health Insurance Plan?</h2>
                            <p>Dental, vision, prescription and physical therapy costs are some of the least covered by OHIP. However, this is not a blanket statement that applies to every service in these categories.</p>
                            <p>For example, vision tests are covered for anyone under the age of 19 or over the age of 65. Below are some of the services that may not be fully covered by OHIP. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Dental and Vision</h3>
                            <p>OHIP will cover certain dental surgeries that are performed in a hospital but will not cover basic services like regular cleanings. Plus, while eye exams are covered, eyewear is not. Many people will either get coverage through their employers or purchase supplemental insurance to cover these costs. </p>
            
                    <h3>Cosmetic and Chiropractic</h3>
                            <p>Cosmetic surgery and most medically unnecessary surgeries are not covered. Chiropractic services and some physical therapy may also require complete or partial out-of-pocket payment. </p>

                        <h2 class="subheading">Mental Health</h2>
                            <p>Canada is a country that recognizes the need for mental health services. Also, most of these mental health services are covered. However, the definition of eligible mental health services covered under OHIP is typically narrowed to only include services provided by medical professionals such as psychiatrists. Other alternative therapy forms may not be covered and you should check for costs before proceeding. </p>
                        
                        <h3>Physiotherapy</h3>
                            <p>Physical therapy is most widely covered for children/teens and elderly persons. It is also covered for persons recovering from specific injuries and illnesses. </p>
                            <p>Eligible physiotherapy will be performed in-clinic and your physician will determine how many sessions you should receive. </p>
                        
                        <h3>Prescriptions</h3>
                            <p>Prescriptions are typically only covered for persons under the age of 25 and for patients during hospital stays. However, the Canadian government does work to keep the cost of prescriptions affordable by negotiating better rates with drug companies when possible. Private insurance can also be purchased to cover more expensive prescriptions. </span></p>
                        
                        <h2 class="subheading">Should You Buy Supplemental Health Insurance? </h2>
                            <p>While citizens have access to many free and low-cost healthcare services, there are still some that are not covered or not fully covered. Similarly, people who are in their 3 month waiting period for coverage or who do not qualify as permanent residents may also need supplemental insurance.</span></p>
                            <p>In many cases, employers will offer insurance to cover things like dental, vision, physiotherapy, prescriptions and other services not fully covered by OHIP. You can also purchase supplemental insurance on your own. </span></p>
                            <p>Supplemental insurance can be beneficial if you need regular access to specialists and therapists not covered under OHIP. Private insurance can help to reduce the costs of prescription eyewear, extensive dental work and prescription medications. </span></p>
                           
                        <h2 class="subheading">Does Ontario Health Insurance Plan Cover Pandemic Care Costs?</h2>
                            <p>As of now, OHIP does cover care related to COVID-19. The Pandemic has also caused some changes in OHIP eligibility. Most notably, anyone who has applied for the insurance but is still in their 3-month waiting period for coverage can still get their care for COVID-19 covered. </span></p>
                            <p>However, if you have any doubts about your eligibility or coverage it is best to <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/apply-ohip-and-get-health-card#:~:text=If%20you%20need%20to%20seek,%2D866%2D532%2D3161%20." data-wpel-link="external" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contact OHIP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directly. This is especially true now as the Pandemic is continuing to cause changes to policies. </span></p>
                        
                        <h2 class="subheading">Need to Find out if OHIP Covers What You Need? </h2>
                            <p>While OHIP fully or partially covers many types of care, procedures and treatments there are still some areas that may not be clear. </p>
                            <p>If you have questions about your health and what OHIP covers for you, <a href="https://lockwoodclinic.com/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BCML physicians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are here to help you navigate your coverage.
